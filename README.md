Hi, we are a startup based in Paris. In the need of saving our team's searching time on google and avoid our fresher teammates' mistakes (that happens sometimes), we are trying to collect all commands, best practice and some libraries that we often use, then put them in one place.

We'd love to share this diagram with you! So, there will have some new features coming like cloning this diagram to use it for your own team.
